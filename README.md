  <h2>About this proyect ✨</h2>
  <h3>
    EmergencySystem is a university project developed by a team of four people, and it has become one of my greatest achievements to date. 
    This project is very complete, since not only the code was developed, but it was also previously modeled using UML. 
    Additionally, a simple interface was created and a database was implemented, resulting in a fully functional system.

  <h2>Proyect description ⌨️​🖱️​</h2>
  <h3>
    EmergencySystem is a medical emergency management system that allows operators to receive and classify calls based on the nature of the emergency. 
    The system implements a classification algorithm that evaluates call parameters to activate specific operations or redirect the call to the 112 emergency number, as necessary. 
    Additionally, it includes an authentication module that identifies the user's role and presents a custom menu of options based on their permissions and responsibilities. 
    It is important to mention that, although a functional architecture has been established, not all the planned functionalities are fully implemented.
